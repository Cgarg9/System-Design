## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**  
```
git clone https://github.com/Cgarg9/System-Design.git
cd System-Design
```
2. **Browse modules**  
Each folder contains a `README.md` with:
- Core concepts and definitions  
- Architectural diagrams  
- Example code snippets  
- Subtopic files (e.g., caching strategies, eviction policy implementations)  
3. **Follow the learning flow**  
a. Start with **Communication Protocols** and **Internet Protocol** to understand network fundamentals.  
b. Move to **DNS**, **Load Balancer**, and **API Gateway** for request routing and traffic management.  
c. Study **Cache**, **CDN**, and **Query Services** to optimize data retrieval and service performance.  
d. Explore **Scaling** principles to learn vertical/horizontal scaling techniques and design patterns.  
4. **Hands-on practice**  
- Run example code in each folder  
- Sketch system designs on a whiteboard or tool of your choice  
- Compare trade-offs for different patterns
